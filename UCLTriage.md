Maximise investment by promoting discoverability, re-use and new
application of existing software.

Strategic goals:

#### Shaping Capability

- *Enabling and promoting collaboration* by identifying relevant and
reusable data and software, in particular with respect to /more
effective collaboration across communities and change 'roll-your-own'
culture/.


#### Developing Leaders and Skilled People

> Build careers at the interface, by supporting researchers to work in
> different research environments (e.g. maths, computer sciences and
> application areas) through discipline hopping type activities and
> networking.

- Promote collaboration and software re-use accross disciplines -
  experimental sciences heavily rely on computational methods;
  numerous breakthrough originated from inputs (novel, but often well
  established) from mathematics, statistics and computer science.

> Develop measures and success features that Universities and Research
> Councils can use to recognise innovation in software provision.

- Re-use, and in particluar across disciplines, is a major halmark of
  success and impact.

#### Delivering Impact

> Delivering Impact: Maximising the academic, societal and economic
> impact of current and future investments in software

> *Support innovation* in software through the short, medium and
> long-term. Providing opportunities for innovation wherever it might
> occur.


#### Ensuring Trust

Quality and suistainability of code

> Develop peer review models that allow the separate assessment of the
> science case vs the software development component.

> Encourage culture of software publishing and peer review scrutiny,
> with acknowledgement of developer contribution.

> Incentivise researchers to share software outputs through OpenSource.

> Build communities of developers and users around software codes.
