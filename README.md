This call will support Research Software Engineer (RSE) Fellowships
for a period of up to five years. The RSE Fellowship describes
exceptional individuals with combined expertise in programming and a
solid knowledge of the research environment. The Research Software
Engineer works with researchers to gain an understanding of the
problems they face, and then develops, maintains and extends software
to provide the answers.

To support the role of RSEs and establish a cohort in the academic
environment, up to £3m is available for this pilot call. Candidates
are invited to provide an ‘Intent to Submit’ document in the first
instance to register interest. Full proposals will be subject to a
rigorous peer review and sift process before a final selection by
interview.

## Background

Software developed for experimental facilities and instrumentation,
modelling, simulation and data-analysis is a critical and valuable
resource. Software and algorithm development represents major
investments by skilled scientists and engineers, and the large suite
of codes and algorithms used in research should be regarded as a
research infrastructure, requiring support and maintenance along the
innovation chain, and throughout its lifecycle.

Through the publication of "EPSRC Software as an Infrastructure
strategy", EPSRC has recognised the importance of investing in
software development. Previous funding has focused on support for the
development of the key software codes that are used by the EPS
community in their research. However, other important aspects of the
strategy are the development of skills and career development for
those engaged in software engineering, and it is these aspects that
this call addresses.

The EPSRC-funded Software Sustainability Institute has begun a
campaign to develop a UK community of Research Software Engineers,
with the aim of raising awareness of their roles, and improving their
career paths and reward/recognition within Universities.

This funding opportunity is a pilot in support of the concept of
Research Software Engineers. For further background, please see the
