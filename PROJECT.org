*** Meta-analyses

Testing software with more data results in more reliable
software. Testing the software with diverse data results in more use
cases and more generally applicable software. Exploring a data set
with different (easily discoverable) software enable better
understanding of the data.


The rational of this project is that to make data (and meta-data) more
interesting, it should be complemented by a diverse set descriptive
obtained by different software platforms. Conversely, to make
software more interesting to a diverse audience, it should be applied
to a breath of data sets across various domains.

Such a platform should enable 

- data and software annotation and interoperation;
- data and software software discoverability;
- data and software re-usability;
- enhanced data and software dissemination;
- emergence of novel data and software use cases;

for all members of the scientific community and public, irrespective
of technical IT skills, knowledge of data formats and data generation
infrastructure, and data/software provenance. 


The domain of high-throughput biology, and more specifically
proteomics will be used as a use case to develop and illustrate the
proposed infrastructure.

** More notes

Example illustrating the difficulty of cross talking between software
and data domains: existence of multiple file formats, annotation and
data provenance, which considerably hinder a systematic exploitation
of data for any or multiple software for expert users (i.e. requires
then to design infrastructure 

The aim of this project is to design and develop an infrastructure
that would serve the scientist communities with data- and
software-as-a-service infrastructures that support transparent cross
talk between data and software.



Building up from 'bare-bone' open source software (some of which I
have developed over the years and maintain) up to transparent on-line
infrastructure, that would be adequate for collaborations with
industry (I have some contacts) and/or commercialisation.


In a nutshell (and open to discussion), I would like to expand the
existing infrastructure for the analysis of high-throughput biology
data (using proteomics and integration of proteomics and genomics as a
use case)


What about taverna? galaxi? AnnotationHub? We want to make use of
this.
