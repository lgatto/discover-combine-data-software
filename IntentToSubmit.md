### A summary of your career to date

After a PhD in evolutionary Biology and complementary studies in
Computer Science, I worked for 3 years in Industry with a focus on
R&D. In 2010, I moved to the University of Cambridge, where I
conventrated on data and software infrastructure for quantitative and
spatial proteomics, first as a Post-doctoral Research Associate and
later as a Senior Research Associate. In recent years, I have been
awarded an SSI fellowship and have become a Software Carpentry
instructor. 

### A brief explanation of why you feel the RSE Fellowship is appropriate for you

Since the completion of my PhD, the emphasis of my work has focused on
delivering software solutions to tackle specific data-driven
scientific questions, that have culminated in several state-of-the-art
software, data and educational packages. The extend to which I can
deliver research software is limited by the constraint academic
setting and the limited opportunities for focused research software
engeniring practice that is required to tackle more substantial
software projects.
